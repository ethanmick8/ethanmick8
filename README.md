- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethanmick8
- 👀 I’m interested discovering solutions to modern problems through the synthesis of data-driven algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how Python and its many libraries are used to write intuitive machine learning algorithms, and I'm excited to be able to apply my learning to some projects of my own in the field soon. 
- 🏫 I'm an incoming junior undergrad at the University of Missouri, and I'm working towards a degree in Computer Science. After discovering a love for Python during my freshman year, I switched into this major and I've been loving every minute of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects pertaining to my current studies, whether it be general purpose Python programming or more specialized projects focused on manipulating/understanding data.
